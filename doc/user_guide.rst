This document contains a description of all stochastic algorithms for learning LDA, and it also contains some tutorials about how to use the useful functions or methods in the library for many purposes. To understand clearly this document, user need to read `quick start`_ document and `lda model`_ first.

`1. Working with data input`_
-----------------------------

This section includes some tutorials for process data input of model (documents - corpus). This corpus maybe supplied by user, or available copus from `wikipedia`_ website (refer to `paper`_ and `source code`_). The library will support preprocessing, converting format of input for specific learning method.

Our library is deployed with 5 inference methods: VB [3]_, CVB0 [4]_, CGS [5]_, `OPE`_, `FW`_ and apply with online scheme, stream scheme or regularized online learning

- Online learning includes methods: Online-VB [2]_, Online-CVB0 [6]_, Online-CGS [5]_, Online-OPE, Online-FW
- Streaming learning includes: Streaming-VB [7]_, Streaming-OPE, Streaming-FW
- Regularized online learning with CGS, FW, OPE: ML-CGS, ML-FW, ML-OPE.

**Default setting parameters**: 

- *Model paramters*: num_topics = 100; :math:`\alpha` = 0.01; :math:`\eta` = 0.01. Such a choice of (:math:`\alpha`, :math:`\eta`) has been observed to work well in many previous studies
- *Inference parameters*: at most 50 iterations were allowed for OPE and VB to do inference. We terminated VB if the relative improvement of the lower bound on likelihood is not better than 10−4. 50 samples were used in CGS for which the first 25 were discarded and the remaining were used to approximate the posterior distribution. 50 iterations were used to do inference in CVB0, in which the first 25 iterations were burned in. Those number of samples/iterations are often enough to get a good inference solution according to [5]_ , [6]_
- *Learning parameters*: :math:`\kappa` = 0.9; :math:`\tau` = 1; in addition to, :math:`\beta` (or :math:`\lambda`) is instructed randomly with a specific distribution, depend on each method learning.
- User can change value of setting parameters above when object of method is created. (see example below)
